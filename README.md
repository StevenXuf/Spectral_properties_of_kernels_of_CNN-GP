# Spectral_properties_of_kernels_of_CNN-GP
This is my Master's project that studies the spectral properties (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) of Hilbert-Schmidt integral operator 
which was applied on Gaussian processes induced by neural networks with infinitely many neurons in hidden layers.

## Preparation for the implementation of code
It is easy to implement the code if you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, please install jupyter notebook using following command:
```
pip3 install notebook
```
for both Mac and Linux systems.
